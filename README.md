*It is a story of a guy, who fell in love in a lady, who has a short-term memory from an accident. How could he make that woman remember the memories they built, if tomorrow is another reseting of her memory?*
- He, tape recorded their bonding(s) every single day. So that everytimme the woman woke up the next day, she would just play the video tape, and remember their pure love.
